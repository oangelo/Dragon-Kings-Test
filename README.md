Dragon-Kings-Test
=================

A test to detect outliers on power law and exponential distribuitions.
The test is from V. F. Pisarenko and D. Sornette publish on a article named
"Robust Statistical Tests of Dragon-Kings: beyond Power Law Distributions"

Power Law
---------
To apply the method to a power law distribution, the log of the data must be
taken. Because the method is valid only for an exponential, and the log of a
power law is an exponential.
